### Prerequisites

cd tts
```

### Step 2: Install Node.js dependencies

sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

**Windows:**
Download from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

### Step 4: Install Coqui TTS (optional, for high-quality voices)

1. Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv coqui-env-py311

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source coqui-env-py311/bin/activate

# On Windows:
# coqui-env-py311\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install Coqui TTS in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install TTS
```

## Running the Application

### Basic Run (Google TTS only)

```bash
npm start
```

### Run with Coqui TTS (if installed)

```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
export VIRTUAL_ENV=$PWD/coqui-env-py311 && node server.js --dev

# On Windows:
# set VIRTUAL_ENV=%CD%\coqui-env-py311 && node server.js --dev
```

## Deployment Considerations

Before deploying to production:

1. Make sure to set proper CORS headers if needed
2. Consider implementing a caching strategy for generated audio files
3. For production environments, you may want to use a process manager like PM2
